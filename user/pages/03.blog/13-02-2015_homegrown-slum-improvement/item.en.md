There are some lanes in Govandi’s Shivaji Nagar, a neighbourhood in northeast
Mumbai, where residents deliberately avoid making their house look good on the
outside. Some local contractors even make an extra effort to ensure that recently
done-up homes look old and shabby. This is mainly to avoid attention from local
municipal authorities who work hard at maintaining the slum-like quality of Shivaji
Nagar. The tension between the willingness of residents to invest in their homes and a
hostile civic environment is a major cause for the perennial presence of slums
everywhere in the city.

Shivaji Nagar stands on soggy ground that was once reclaimed from marsh. This is one
of many things it shares with the more notorious ’slums of Dharavi’, only a few
kilometres away. Other shared features include hyper-density, a dramatic lack of
infrastructure and a population that has historically been discriminated against.
Whether they are poor Muslims or low-caste Hindus, most of them have to make do
with some of the lowest quality of life levels in the city.

Residents of Shivaji Nagar are well aware that the gas fumes emanating from the
nearby dumping ground – the largest in Mumbai – are not exactly salubrious. Large
parts of the neighbourhood do not have running water, and most streets have open
drains – all to be expected in places that have grown outside any planning and
regulatory framework. However, Shivaji Nagar, now called a slum even by municipal
officers, was originally a planned resettlement colony. It was created in the 1980s to
house displaced slum dwellers from other parts of Mumbai.

How it became a slum is a story of prejudice, inadequate and inflexible regulations,
institutional corruption, and lack of political vision.

The result is a neighbourhood that today develops without any support and against all
odds. Residents push above and beyond the once well-gridded street network, palliating
the poor infrastructure with makeshift systems that are both innovative and insufficient.
Yet, for a vast majority of residents, leaving is not an option.

Having a home in the pulsating economic capital of India means access to employment
and education. Being in Shivaji Nagar is no sinecure, but what could be more precious
than a better life in the making?
Clichés
Yet, visitors expecting to see a slum populated by depressed souls begging for
subsistence are quite surprised to see something else altogether. Far from the
clichés of the villa miseria, Shivaji Nagar is – for the most part – an upbeat
neighbourhood, where the sound of houses being repaired and rebuilt syncs with
everyday life, and where street markets are as busy as suburban trains. In Shivaji
Nagar, as in Dharavi, many houses double up as home-factories producing all kinds of
goods ranging from embroidery to cosmetics. A web of local artisans takes orders from
all over the city for iron grills, wood furniture or polystyrene models.

Nowhere is the enmeshing of livelihood with living spaces as obvious as in the
construction sector. Squads of specialized masons, plumbers, bricklayers, concrete
mixers, plasterers, and electricians serve the insatiable local demand for improvement.
A 300-feet house would typically take just a little over a month to build with nearly 100
people working in a well-choreographed construction ritual. Most of these labourers live
in the neighbourhood, which means that at least part of what they earn is spent back in
the local economy.

Shivaji Nagar’s artisans of construction are experts at dealing with constraints that
would make most architects balk: limited availability of space and resources, the
shallowness of the ground and corrosive weather. Add to that an indifferent or
antagonistic middle-class opinion. But the biggest hurdle of all for neighbourhood builders is the generally hostile bureaucratic and legal context in which they have to
operate. For instance, antiquated regulations mean that building a second floor,
reinforced walls or a toilet inside a house are illegal.

People’s basic aspirations for better living are monetized in the form of bribes, which
represent millions of dollars of informal revenue for some unscrupulous officers. The
problem, however, is not as much corruption per se as inadequate policy, which create
a black market for construction permits, much in the same way fixed exchange rates
create a black market for currency. The worst case scenario would be to address
corruption without addressing its root cause.

While incremental improvement by capable local builders and perseverant residents is
virtuous and deserving of support, it won’t be enough to realize the potential of Shivaji
Nagar and other burgeoning, struggling neighbourhoods in Mumbai and elsewhere.
What Mumbai needs more than ever is an official strategy based on the recognition of
the internal dynamism of spaces that have been marginalized and repressed for far too
long, and a clear mandate for the government to provide infrastructure and amenities
that they lack so badly.

It is also time for authorities to come up with new policies for slums, which would
formally recognize the occupancy rights of residents of Shivaji Nagar and other
‘homegrown’ neighbourhoods, so they can at last build on solid ground.
For this to happen, the government must turn the page over several decades of failed
slum rehabilitation policy and realize that the most radical and innovative path may be
the one that residents have carved for themselves.

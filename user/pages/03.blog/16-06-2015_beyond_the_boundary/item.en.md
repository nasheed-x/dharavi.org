Classifying habitats as distinctly rural and urban is not as straightforward as it seems. What a
city has come to mean today – a discrete unit cut off from rural ways of living – has not always
been understood in the same way all through history.

Classifying habitats as distinctly rural and urban is not as straightforward as it seems. What a
city has come to mean today – a discrete unit cut off from rural ways of living – has not always
been understood in the same way all through history.

In the age of the British empire on the Indian subcontinent – the great presidency port-cities of
Bombay, Calcutta and Madras, merged with the hinterlands they ruled with a similar sense of
continuity. And people moved from habitat to habitat across the presidency sprawl – sometimes
rural to urban and sometimes the other way round without marking the movement as a shift in
terms of identity.

Thus a resident of Ratnagiri, a district, 400 kilometers south of the old Bombay city, left his
village to come to the city to work – but still managed to keep a sense of connection to his or her
erstwhile home. He could even work in the fields during the rainy season and return to his textile
factory after that.

Maybe it is for this reason that a city like Bombay, during the years it was also emerging as the
economic powerhouse of western India, absorbed a wide variety of migrant – itinerant
communities, allowing them to flow through its streets and by-lanes. Some of them were
officially marked out as nomads who were practicing their trades and occupations moving in and
out of the city – just as they moved from village to village practicing their trade. The earliest
ethnographic account of Mumbai – written by Govind Narayan in the mid-19th century,
dedicates a significant portion to the city’s itinerant communities.

Of course, as the decades passed by, the city’s attitude changed. As urban identities became
stronger – the authorities tended to become suspicious of such communities in particular.
Colonial acts in the Bombay presidency, targeted nomadic groups, classifying them as criminal
tribes – after having destroyed their pathways, or installing strong road-blocks on their traditional
routes. They often tried to integrate them into the political system by settling them down, sometimes in the metropolis, sometimes in smaller towns or on the peripheries of villages. A
clash of cultures produced narratives of criminality, much in the way the Romas (or gypsies) of
Europe) became victims of the political re-configuration and hardening of boundaries on that
sub-continent in the 19th and 20th centuries.

These attitudes spilled over into the political discourse of civic administration. The city’s
workforce – most of them disorganized – were seen much in the same way as the nomadic
tribes. Their criminality was associated with their habitats – which reflected their fluid status –
not quite rural or urban – existing on the fault-lines of various newly constituted legalities. The
seasonal nature of the workforce – with workers leaving during the monsoon season, became
entangled in notions of indiscipline. Yet – the city carried on and even today, much of its
work-force is constantly part of movements and mobility patterns that connects them to points of
origin that are far away – often in villages. Today the footprint goes all the way to Bihar and
Orissa.

Families and communities also reproduced their traditional habitats within the folds of the city’s
boundaries to create a very diverse weave of urban forms – some of which were markedly
‘rural’. This happened at different moments in the city’s history. When the port area was the
dominant economic activity, educated middle classes from the East Indian community arrived
from the peripheries and set up homes outside the port precinct. At that time, the village
template worked well. Today the same habitats, like Mahtar Pakhadi and Khotachiwadi, have
become anachronistic spaces, only making sense as the city’s heritage narrative.

The same process also happened with working class groups from the mill areas – but along a
different timeline. Initially, they were all part of the urban working class neighbourhoods, typified
by the chawls (barrack like single room homes with common toilets). Then with the decline of
mills – especially from the 1980s onwards, the same families moved up north, to places like
Bhandup and reverted to homes that evoked their villages in Ratnagiri, even calling the
neighbourhoods Konkan Nagar, after the coastal region that connects Mumbai to Ratnagiri.

Going deeper in this process – we find thinkers like Anthony Leeds and James Scott – clearly
pointing out the moments in which the hardening of the categories rural and urban emerged.
Leeds suggests that it appeared during the industrial revolution while Scott believes that it
accompanies statecraft procedures that tried to settle down movements of communities over
large terrains from much prior to that.

Either way, it revealed a process that became increasingly rigid as communities were labelled
and classified as being rural, urban or nomadic as per the interests of state control.
In the context of India, colonial impulses moved in many contrary directions. Force settling of
societies, the development of the railways, new agrarian and revenue systems, disciplining
subaltern urban populations, criminalising nomadic groups due to their persistent propensity to
be mobile created a messy template – the after effects of which can still be seen in their impact
on the physical landscape of the city.

Mumbai continues to have urban villages within its fold and its many so-called slums share
characteristics with villages from miles away. Moreover, many of its citizens cannot be clearly
marked out as having ‘urban’ characteristics. At the same time, the hinterland around Mumbai,
even at considerable distance from the nucleus of the city itself, carries traces of a much larger
political imagination. Goa is still legally controlled by the High Court of Bombay, and the
University of Mumbai imposes its jurisdiction three hundred kilometers down the coast in
Chiplun town.

Of course, today these processes are seen to be vestiges of a faded past. Most contemporary
urban experiences have moved down a completely different path today, especially after the
second world war. This moment, in many ways, became the starting point of urban practices
that started to universalize and harden urban boundaries and definitions even more – collapsing
it with new economic policies that saw the city as sites of consumption and financial
management.

In fact cities like Bombay and Calcutta which still see imprints of an earlier era, especially in
their uneven textures – Bombay more than Calcutta – have resigned themselves to being part of
narrative that classifies them as backward in the context of a pure urban moment. The image of the slum fits neatly into such readings – becoming a short hand way of expressing impatience
about what they are – neither really rural or urban in clear-cut ways....

(These notes are part of a series starting this week that explores the nature of circulating urban
systems that characterize much of India – with a focus on Mumbai and the Konkan, as part of
our study with the Forum for Mobile Lives, Paris.).
